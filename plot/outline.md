# Plot Outline

## Pre-campaign

* The PCs are a newly formed special forces squad, a "STAR" unit (Specialized Tactical Autonomous Reconnaissance). 
 * Members are drawn from different disciplines, but are each expected to be able to sneak their way in, and talk, fight, or fly their way out of any situation.
 * Teams have some initial training, but the rebellion can't afford long and expensive training regimens. On the job training is expected. (Explaining PC progression).
 * Teams are largely on their own. Alliance support might be available, depending on the circumstances (The "A" for "Autonomous" in "STAR").

## Initial mission
* The Empire has recently increased the intensity of its operations in the sector. Find out what they are doing, why, and what could be done to disrupt them.
