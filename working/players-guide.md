# Player's Guide

Premise
Characters are members of the Rebel Alliance, intent on defeating the Empire.

This premise is intentionally open ended. Players can set and achieve goals, but there’s never a definite “Ending”. There will always be more to do. The campaign is not intended to end in the utter eradication of every trace of the Empire. There is no implied arc to bring to a close.

The premise is foundational. If the players wish to join the Empire and hunt rebel scum, become smugglers in a seedy spaceport, or explore beyond the reaches of the galaxy, a different campaign would be more suitable.

Philosophy
Emergent Story
Players create the story as they interact with a galaxy responding to their actions.
There is no pre-written story to follow, no pre-determined encounters or outcomes. The narrative emerges from the players interacting with the game world the GM generates and presents in response to their intentions, preferences, and actions.
Player Agency
Players choose the challenges that interest them and forge their own solutions.
The direction the game takes is entirely in the hands of the players, who are encouraged to seek out gameplay experiences that interest them. Their successes and failures will be their own.
Living World
Time is a resource the players must spend wisely.
Time marches onward and the galaxy evolves while the players’ attention turns elsewhere. The war machine of the Empire lumbers relentlessly forward on unopposed fronts. Revisited locales may not remain as they were left. Power vacuums may fill, untaken opportunities may vanish, and new challenges may emerge.

Gameplay
Strategy
Battle
Players will have the opportunity to directly engage Imperial forces in combat to further their goals. The scale of combat can be anywhere from a small skirmish between individuals to a massive battle. Combat may be on the ground, in the air, in space

Character Creation
Make a balanced character.
Players should have at least one strong physical stat (Br, Ag), and at least one strong mental stat (Int, Cun, Will, Pr).
Players should have at least one strong skill (from ranks, stats, or both) in each skill category and subcategory (Technical, Mental, Physical, Interpersonal, Combat, and Knowledge).

Competent Combat Pilots
PCs will often find themselves working as a squadron of independent starfighters or planetary vehicles. Each player will need to be able to hold their own and contribute in these settings, though by no means must they specialize in these areas.

Interpersonal Competence

The team will often find themselves in interpersonal situations with NPCs. Each PC will need to be able to hold their own and contribute in such circumstances, though by no means must they specialize in these areas.
Team members should spread out and cover as many different interpersonal skills as possible, although some overlap can be perfectly fine (and helpful for assists!)

Competent Ground Combatants
The team will often find themselves on foot in a live combat environment. Each PC will need to be able to hold their own and contribute under such conditions, though by no means must they specialize in these areas.

The “Face”
In many RPGs, one PC usually takes the role of the “Face” of the group. This is undesirable as it results in only one player being engaged during social interactions, with the rest becoming bored and wondering when a gameplay segment which focuses on their specialized skill set will happen next.

To avoid this, no one PC should be the “Face”, and instead everyone should have the means and chance to meaningfully contribute to most social encounters.

Roleplaying
Tie it to the fiction.
This is a guideline that everyone should use while roleplaying. Rather than naming a specific skill or game mechanic (e.g. “I make an athletics check”), think about what your character is doing in the world (e.g. “I climb down the cliff carefully”). Not only is this more atmospheric and immersive for everyone, but it also can result in more outside-the-box thinking as everyone is less constrained by the letter of the rules.

Roleplay in a style that is comfortable for you.
Some people like to speak in the first-person (e.g. “I fire at the stormtrooper). Some people like to speak in the third person perspective, specifically naming their character (e.g. “Han fires at the stormtrooper”), while others will not mention their character by name (“My guy fires at the stormtrooper”). Some may add narrative flair to their actions (“I snap the sight on the stormtrooper and squeeze the trigger”); they might speak the words their character says (“while shouting ‘You’ll never take us alive!’”), or even speak directly in the character’s voice with appropriate tone, an accent, speech mannerisms, or other distinguishing characteristics.
ALL of the above styles are acceptable. Everyone should feel free to use any style (or several!) that they feel comfortable with. Each player might choose their own style, and none are inherently superior to the others. Under no circumstances should anyone be made to feel that they should use a style they aren’t comfortable with, even if everyone else is using it. The important part is that you tie it to the fiction.

Intent and Approach
The two most important things to communicate to the GM when you are roleplaying or taking an action are intent and approach. One or both of these can be implicit in how you communicate your action (e.g. “I climb down the cliff carefully” because I don’t want to get hurt). Sometimes however, it can be ambiguous. “I shoot at the rancor” is fine by itself, but circumstances may warrant more carefully choosing your action.
Specifying your intent clarifies either what you actually intend on doing (“I aim for the rancor’s arm”), what outcome you’re hoping to achieve (“so it drops my friend”). This can be vital information for the GM to have, as they can often advise you of things you may not be considering (“The rancor is very tall. If it drops your friend, they could be hurt badly by the fall. Are you sure?”)
Specifying your approach clarifies how you’re going about your action (“I
