All humans?
Small cell of rebel agents on a neutral world. Little direct support from the alliance
Empire outlaws human slavery (not alien slavery however). Some rebellious factions want it back (pirates/raiders/religious zealots?)

PCs
Proactive, Competent, Dramatic

Setting
Modern world with bustling urban centers (but not a “city planet”, too homogenous)

Scale
Middle. Dealing with the fate of a planet/system rather than the whole galaxy, but also larger than just what’s going on in small towns.

Flavor
Uprising - Syria-inspired

Current Issues
Imperial occupation/oppression - provoked by what?
Insurgent retaliation

Impending Issues
Imperial Invasion - conflict could escalate if the situation worsens
Societal collapse - the planet is hanging on by a thread

"Alderaan was an inside job. Lasers can't melt planetary cores."
