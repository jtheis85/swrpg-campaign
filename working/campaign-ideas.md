PCs
Proactive, Competent, Dramatic

Setting
Modern world with bustling urban centers (but not a “city planet”, too homogenous)

Scale
Middle. Dealing with the fate of a planet/system rather than the whole galaxy, but also larger than just what’s going on in small towns.

Flavor
Uprising - Syria-inspired

Current Issues
Imperial occupation/oppression - provoked by what?
Insurgent retaliation

Impending Issues
Imperial Invasion - conflict could escalate if the situation worsens
Societal collapse - the planet is hanging on by a thread

Factions

Major
- Galactic Empire – “Lawful Evil” – The ultimate power in the universe, the Empire promises order but at the price of oppression.
- Rebel Alliance – “Chaotic Good” – The hopeless underdog, the Alliance promises freedom but at the price of instability and the possibility of utter defeat. Adheres to high-minded ideals even at the expense of victory.
- 5th Fleet – “Lawful Good” – Horrified by the atrocities committed by their government but unable to envision a future without it, these misguided patriots seek to change the Empire from within.
- Sons of Alderaan – “Chaotic Evil” – Vengeful for the destruction of their homeworld and frustrated with the restraint of the Rebel Alliance. Resorts to effective but morally gray acts of violence and terrorism.

Minor
- Shadow Ops – A wildcard with unknown motives. Who are they working for, and what do they want? Allies as often as they are enemies.
- Pirate Flotilla – While they will answer to no one, they could perhaps be lured one way or another, if they smell blood in the water.
- Trade Consortium Private Military Corporation – An opportunistic organization on sale to the highest bidder. Could tip the balance of power for one side or another, at least until they get a better offer.

NPCs

Major
- Imperial Moff – A harsh but efficient ruler.

- Rebel Alliance Diplomat – An idealistic but naïve visionary.
- Admiral of the 5th Fleet – A dutiful soldier but stubborn and inflexible.

- Leader of the Sons of Alderaan - A charismatic and ruthless radical.

Minor
- Shadow Ops Captain – Detached, enigmatic, and unpredictable.

- Pirate Warlord – Lusts for power
- Trade Consortium PMC CEO – Logical, shrewd, and calculating, with no sense of honor or loyalty. Obsessed with building a legacy.
