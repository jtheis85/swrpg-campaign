Major
- Sector Command – “Lawful Evil” – The bulk of the Empire's forces in the sector. The ultimate power in the universe, the Empire promises order but at the price of oppression.
- New Dawn – "Neutral Good" – The hopeless underdog, the Alliance promises freedom but at the price of instability and the possibility of utter defeat. Adheres to high-minded ideals even at the expense of victory.
- 5th Fleet – “Lawful Good” – Horrified by the atrocities committed by their government but unable to envision a future without it, these misguided patriots seek to change the Empire from within.
- Sons of Alderaan – “Chaotic Evil” – Vengeful for the destruction of their homeworld and frustrated with the restraint of the Rebel Alliance. Resorts to effective but morally gray acts of violence and terrorism.

Minor
- Shadow Ops – A wildcard with unknown motives. Who are they working for, and what do they want? Allies as often as they are enemies.
- Pirate Flotilla – While they will answer to no one, they could perhaps be lured one way or another, if they smell blood in the water.
- Trade Consortium Private Military Corporation – An opportunistic organization on sale to the highest bidder. Could tip the balance of power for one side or another, at least until they get a better offer.
-  - A ring of troublemaking slicers and hacktivists with self-defeating tendancies
